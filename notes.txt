VirtualProtect(adr_to_effect, size, effect, previousProtectionValueOfFirstPage)

The constant 0x1000 in the call to VirtualProtect() represents 
the size of the memory region (in bytes) for which the protection attributes are being set.
The value 0x1000 is equivalent to 4096 in decimal, 
which is the size of a memory page on many systems (commonly referred to as a "page size").
